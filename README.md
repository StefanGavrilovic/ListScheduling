Simulator for list scheduling algorithm.

This project was a part of course called Parallel Computing Systems. 
Here you can see implementation of List Scheduling algorithm and visualisation of algorithm steps on ideal machine.
Implementation was done in Java programming language, using JavaFX for GUI.
